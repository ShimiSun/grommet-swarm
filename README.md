Welcome to Swarm Learning Frontend app.

The next wave of machine intelligence, Swarm Learning, is uncovering value in data like never before to solve some of the worldâ€™s most significant challenges. Hear this explained in a way for all to understand. Today, machines are trained at the core with prediction and action happening at the edge. Yet, with so much data lost, due to privacy, regulations, or sheer size, getting accurate predictions is elusive. But what if we could remove these barriers with AI, IoT and blockchain to train machines at the edge, where the data source lives. Find out more: https://www.hpe.com.

HPE Swarm Learning is a decentralized machine learning framework built on blockchain. HPE Labs is taking on challenges in machine learning such as low efficency, the lack of data privacy, and breaking down data silos and building data collaboration. HPE Labs views data bias as a critical issue to be faced with current machine learning models. Swarm Learning helps reduce the impact of environmental and population data bias.
